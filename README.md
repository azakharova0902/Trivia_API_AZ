# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

This is a Trivia API project created with Flask.

This application can:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app gave me the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling my future applications to communicate with others.
